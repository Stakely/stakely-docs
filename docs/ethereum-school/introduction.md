# Introduction

In the ethereal realms of the Ethereum School, disciples gather under the glowing aura of the blockchain, where Vitalik Buterin is revered not just as a founder, but as the ultimate sage, guiding souls through the cryptic scrolls of smart contracts. This monastery, inspired by the legendary Kung Fu Panda, is where warriors of code seek enlightenment in the mystical arts of Ethereum, mastering the delicate balance between gas fees and the great Dao, all while pursuing the sacred path to becoming blockchain bodhisattvas under the benevolent gaze of the almighty Vitalik.
