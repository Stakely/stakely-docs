# Authentication

This section explains how to authenticate requests to the Stakely Staking API and securely interact with its endpoints.


## Create API keys

To use the Staking API, you must have an account on <AppUrl />. If you do not have one yet, you can <AppUrl path="/sign-up">register here</AppUrl>.

Once registered, <AppUrl path="/sign-in">log in to your account</AppUrl>. A single account provides access to all Stakely products, including the Staking API.

API keys are managed from the Staking API dashboard at <AppUrl path="/staking-api" />. From there, you can create new keys, view existing ones, and revoke keys when no longer needed.


## Using API keys

All API requests must be authenticated using an API key generated through the Staking API dashboard.

Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header with every request:

```http
X-API-KEY: your-api-key-here
```

Examples and ready-to-use code snippets in different programming languages are provided in later sections of the documentation, within each network-specific integration guide.



## Response signature verification (optional)

As an additional security measure, each HTTP response includes a cryptographic signature in the `x-signature` response header. This signature allows clients to verify the integrity and authenticity of the response payload.

The signature is generated by signing the SHA-256 hash of the HTTP response body using Stakely’s RSA private key. Clients can verify the signature using the corresponding RSA public key provided below.

Signature verification on the client side is optional but recommended, especially for integrations requiring additional guarantees around data integrity.


### Example: signature verification in Node.js

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(publicKey, data, signature) {
  const verifier = crypto.createVerify('RSA-SHA256');
  verifier.update(data);
  return verifier.verify(publicKey, signature, 'base64');
}

// Example usage
const publicKey = '-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----';
const receivedData = '{"data":"Example payload"}';
const receivedSignature = 'signature-from-x-signature-header';

const isValid = verifySignature(publicKey, receivedData, receivedSignature);
console.log('Is the signature valid?', isValid);
```


### Next steps

Once authenticated, you can start interacting with the network-specific staking endpoints described in the following sections.
