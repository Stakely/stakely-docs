# What is the Stakely Staking API

Welcome to the **Staking API Suite** by Stakely, a B2B solution designed to integrate staking functionalities into your applications. Tailored for non-custodial wallets, centralized service providers, and custodians, our API suite offers a set of endpoints that provide your platform with staking capabilities, enhancing your service offering and user experience.


## Core Functionalities

Our Staking API Suite is comprised of two primary components, each designed to streamline your operations and provide your users with an intuitive staking experience:

- **Crafting API**: This API facilitates the creation of transaction payloads for a variety of staking-related actions, such as stake, unstake, claim rewards, and undelegate. Beyond crafting, this API directly supports the broadcasting of these transactions using our infrastructure, once they have been signed client-side. This ensures a secure and non-custodial process from creation to execution.

- **Reporting API**: To aid in the transparency and management of staking activities, our Reporting API provides detailed staking data and on-chain information. This includes historical actions performed via the Crafting API and blockchain data, allowing for comprehensive tracking and analysis of staking operations.


## Key Features

- **Multi-Network Support**: Understanding the diverse landscape of blockchain networks, our APIs are designed to be as generic as possible, offering support for several blockchain ecosystems. This ensures that your platform can cater to a wide range of user preferences and requirements.

- **Secure Authentication**: Access to our API endpoints is safeguarded by API Keys, ensuring that only authorized users can utilize these services. Additionally, we include a security mechanism to guarantee the integrity of the payloads sent by the API. This mechanism ensures that data transmitted between your platform and our APIs remains unaltered and secure.

- **Public Documentation and API Specs:** To facilitate easy integration and provide transparency, we offer publicly available documentation and API specifications. These resources are regularly maintained and updated, providing you with the guidance needed to effectively utilize our APIs.

- **Custodial integration:** Our API supports integration with custodians, such as Fireblocks. This allows you to manage assets securely and efficiently through trusted custodial services. We provide documentation and examples to help you seamlessly integrate these custodians with our API.
